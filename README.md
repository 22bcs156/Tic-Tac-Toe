##  Features

- 👥 Two-player mode (Player X vs Player O)
- ✅ Automatic win detection
- 🔄 Draw condition handling
- 🧠 Input validation for invalid moves
- 📊 Dynamic board update after each turn
- 💻 Simple console-based interface

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts Applied:**
  - Arrays
  - Conditional Statements
  - Loops
  - Functions
  - Game Logic
  - Input Validation

## 🎯 Game Rules

1. The game board consists of 9 positions (3x3 grid).
2. Player 1 uses **X**.
3. Player 2 uses **O**.
4. Players take turns choosing a position (1–9).
